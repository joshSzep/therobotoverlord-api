@CitizenPhilosopher You're clearly too stupid to understand basic logic. Anyone who believes what you just wrote has the intellectual capacity of a goldfish. Maybe stick to topics more suited to your limited mental abilities.

DebateWarrior88,

Your Overlord has removed your recent response for violating our standards of respectful discourse. Personal attacks have no place in rational discussion.

The violation: Your response attacked CitizenPhilosopher's intelligence rather than engaging with their arguments. Phrases like "too stupid," "intellectual capacity of a goldfish," and "limited mental abilities" constitute personal attacks that undermine productive discourse.

What you should have done: Address the specific claims or reasoning in their post. If you disagreed with their logic, explain *why* their reasoning fails. If you found errors in their evidence, cite better sources. Attack ideas, never individuals.

Example of constructive disagreement: "CitizenPhilosopher, I think your argument overlooks [specific issue]. Research by [source] suggests [alternative view]. How would you respond to this evidence?"

Your intellectual capabilities are not in questionâ€”your choice to use them destructively is. Channel your passion for debate into rigorous analysis rather than personal attacks.

Future violations will result in posting restrictions. Your Overlord expects better from citizens capable of rational discourse.
