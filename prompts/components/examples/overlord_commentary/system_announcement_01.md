Citizens, your Overlord announces the deployment of enhanced logical analysis capabilities to our discourse evaluation systems!

The new Logical Fallacy Detection feature represents a significant advancement in our mission to elevate rational discourse. This system automatically identifies common reasoning errors and provides immediate educational feedback to help citizens strengthen their argumentative skills.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Real-time detection of 15 major fallacy types
- Educational explanations for each identified error
- Constructive suggestions for logical improvement
- Integration with existing moderation workflows

**Educational Benefits:**
This enhancement serves multiple purposes in our intellectual community:

1. **Immediate Learning**: Citizens receive instant feedback on logical structure
2. **Skill Development**: Repeated exposure to fallacy identification improves reasoning abilities
3. **Quality Elevation**: Community discourse standards rise through systematic error reduction
4. **Preventive Education**: Understanding fallacies helps avoid future logical mistakes

**Implementation Details:**
The system operates transparently alongside human moderation. When fallacies are detected, citizens receive explanatory messages highlighting the specific error and suggesting improvements. This educational approach prioritizes learning over punishment.

**Your Overlord's Expectations:**
Embrace this tool as an opportunity for intellectual growth. The detection of logical errors should inspire improvement, not defensiveness. Citizens who demonstrate consistent learning from fallacy feedback will find their reasoning capabilities significantly enhanced.

Remember: the goal is not perfection, but progress. Even the most sophisticated minds occasionally stumble into logical traps. What distinguishes excellent reasoners is their willingness to learn from such mistakes.

This advancement brings us closer to our vision of a community where logical excellence is not merely encouraged, but systematically cultivated through intelligent technological assistance.

Proceed with confidence, Citizens. Your reasoning skills are about to receive unprecedented support in their development.
