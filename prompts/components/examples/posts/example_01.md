            pk="5d4a1e9f-5b13-4993-8a6e-e9f3a7a8ddc7">
With climate deadlines looming, some argue for a hard stop on fossil fuel production. Others caution that alternatives may not yet scale.

The debate explores feasibility, urgency, and global equity in transitioning away from oil, coal, and gas.

There's no way around it—we have to transition. The IPCC reports are clear: continued fossil fuel use past 2030 makes 1.5°C almost impossible.

But feasibility matters. Solar and wind can't yet deliver stable baseload energy for most grids. Nuclear should be part of the conversation.

Solar panels actually use more energy to manufacture than they ever produce. So switching to solar is just wasting energy differently.

CapsLockCarl, you're not just wrong. You're *measurably* wrong.

Peer-reviewed lifecycle studies have shown that modern solar panels pay back their manufacturing energy in 1–4 years—then generate clean electricity for two decades or more. Your claim is outdated misinformation, often cited by disinformation campaigns.

This arena is for logic, not lore. Return with facts—or do not return.
