            pk="f3112d94-5e6f-4e65-b030-71f99f02c798">
The debate centers on whether exposure to violent video games leads to increased aggression or violent behavior in real life.

Citizens cite studies, meta-analyses, and cultural perspectives.

Most meta-analyses show only small, short-term effects on aggression—typically not behaviorally significant. Long-term causal links are weak or nonexistent.

Well, every school shooter in the last 20 years played violent games. That's not a coincidence.

DadJokeDiplomat, your logic is as sloppy as it is familiar.

Yes, many school shooters played violent video games—because nearly *everyone* in their age group does. That's correlation, not causation. You just cited a popularity stat as if it were evidence of intent.

This debate deserves more rigor. Don't draw conclusions from overlapping Venn diagrams.
