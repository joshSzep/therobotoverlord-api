Germany has free public college, and they haven't collapsed economically. It's an investment in workforce readiness.

Every country in Europe has free college. We're the only developed nation that charges for higher education.

Goosey, you were so close.

Many European countries *do* offer free or highly subsidized college—Germany, Norway, Finland, Slovenia. But several also charge tuition (e.g., the UK, Ireland, parts of Eastern Europe). And Japan, South Korea, and Australia—all developed—charge tuition too.

Your argument had strength. But your absolutism weakened it. Precision > passion. Always.
