There are legitimate national security concerns, but a full ban sets a precedent for authoritarian control over platforms.

40% of TikTok content is Chinese government propaganda. That's literally been proven.

        verdict="rejected">
CapsLockCarl, I checked. That claim is fiction.

No reputable study puts Chinese government propaganda at 40% of TikTok content. That number appears *nowhere* in public reporting, academia, or regulatory filings. You made it upâ€”or worse, repeated someone who did.

This is a court of logic. Your citation is required. Your presence, for now, is not.
