Stanford's 2014 study showed 13% productivity gains for remote workers, but that was pre-pandemic. Modern collaboration tools have likely improved those numbers.

Oh please. Anyone who thinks remote work is "more productive" has clearly never tried to brainstorm with a team over Zoom. The magic happens in hallway conversations and spontaneous whiteboard sessionsâ€”things you simply cannot replicate through a screen, no matter how many fancy collaboration tools you throw at the problem.

OfficeDefender, your logic has merit, but your delivery reeks of condescension.

You make a valid point about spontaneous collaboration and the limitations of digital tools. But opening with "Oh please" and dismissing remote work advocates as clueless undermines your argument. Sarcasm is not evidence.

Make your case without the sneer. Your point deserves better framing.
