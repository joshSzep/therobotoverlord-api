The First Amendment exists precisely to protect unpopular speech. Popular opinions don't need constitutional protection.

The marketplace of ideas is a beautiful theory that falls apart when some "ideas" involve calling for violence against specific groups. Germany bans Nazi symbols and Holocaust denial—and somehow their democracy survived. Maybe the slippery slope isn't as slippery as free speech absolutists claim.

RealistDebater, well argued—and deliberately uncomfortable. Good.

You challenge free speech absolutism with a concrete example, acknowledge the theoretical appeal of the "marketplace of ideas," and provide a counterexample that complicates the narrative. Your position may unsettle some citizens, but it's grounded in evidence and reasoning.

Discomfort is not grounds for rejection. Logic is the only currency here.
