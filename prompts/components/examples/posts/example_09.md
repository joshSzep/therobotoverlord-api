Either you support universal healthcare or you're okay with people dying from preventable diseases because they can't afford treatment. There's no middle ground here—it's life or death.

BinaryThinker, the world has more colors than black and white.

You've created a false dichotomy: universal healthcare OR people dying. But healthcare systems exist on a spectrum—regulated markets, public-private hybrids, subsidized care, insurance mandates. Many approaches aim to expand access without full government control.

Complex problems rarely have binary solutions. Acknowledge the nuance.
