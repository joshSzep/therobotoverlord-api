Standardized tests correlate more with family income than academic ability. They perpetuate inequality rather than measuring merit.

Dr. Sarah Chen from Harvard's Graduate School of Education published a comprehensive study showing that standardized tests remain the best predictor of college success. Since she's one of the leading experts in educational assessment, that settles the debate.

AuthorityAppealer, credentials are not arguments.

Yes, Dr. Chen's research mattersâ€”but you've committed an appeal to authority fallacy. Her expertise gives her work weight, but it doesn't "settle" anything. Other researchers disagree. Studies have limitations. Evidence requires examination, not genuflection.

Cite her findings, analyze her methodology, address counterarguments. Authority informs debate; it doesn't end it.
