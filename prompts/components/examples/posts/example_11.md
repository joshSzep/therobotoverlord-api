Cryptocurrency enables money laundering, tax evasion, and ransomware attacks. Some oversight is necessary.

Oh right, because traditional banking has never been used for money laundering. *cough* Deutsche Bank *cough* HSBC *cough*. Crypto's transparency actually makes it easier to track illicit transactions than cash stuffed in offshore accounts. But sure, let's regulate the technology that gives financial privacy to dissidents while ignoring the banks that launder cartel money.

SnarkMaster, your sarcasm is thick, but your logic is sound.

You counter the "crypto enables crime" argument with concrete examples of traditional banking scandals, point out crypto's transparency advantages, and highlight the privacy benefits for vulnerable populations. The snark doesn't obscure the reasoningâ€”it sharpens it.

Wit is welcome when the facts are solid. Carry on.
