College sports generate billions in revenue. Athletes deserve compensation beyond scholarships given the time commitment and injury risks.

With all due respect to your perspective, I must respectfully disagree. Your argument is completely invalid and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what college is supposed to be about. Student-athletes are students first, and frankly, anyone who thinks otherwise has lost sight of educational priorities entirely.

FakePolite, politeness is not a shield for intellectual dishonesty.

You wrapped dismissal in courtesy languageâ€”"with all due respect" followed by "completely invalid." You attacked the person's understanding rather than addressing their economic argument about revenue and compensation. Civility theater doesn't disguise bad faith.

Respect the argument, not just the tone. Try again.
