Nuclear power produces 20% of U.S. electricity with virtually zero carbon emissions. Expanding it could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Well, we can't even have a serious conversation about nuclear energy until we address the real problem: billionaires flying private jets while lecturing us about carbon footprints. Fix the wealth inequality first, then we can talk about energy policy.

ThreadHijacker, you've derailed this train of thought entirely.

The topic is nuclear energy's role in climate policy. You've pivoted to wealth inequality and private jetsâ€”a different conversation entirely. Yes, hypocrisy exists. No, it doesn't invalidate the nuclear energy debate.

Stay on the tracks. Address the argument, not adjacent grievances.
