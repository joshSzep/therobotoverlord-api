Current minimum wage hasn't kept pace with inflation. Workers need living wages to afford basic necessities.

Mistakes were made in previous wage policy decisions. It's been suggested by economists that rapid wage increases could lead to job losses. Some say small businesses would be hurt by higher labor costs. Studies have shown mixed results on employment effects.

PassiveVoiceUser, your evasions are showing.

"Mistakes were made"—by whom? "It's been suggested"—by which economists? "Some say"—who exactly? You've constructed an argument from shadows, using passive voice to avoid accountability for your claims.

Own your arguments. Name your sources. Take a position. Cowardly grammar makes for cowardly debate.
