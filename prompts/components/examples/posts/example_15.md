The American Psychological Association found limited evidence linking violent games to increased aggression, with most effects being short-term and mild.

Actually, studies show that 73% of children who play violent video games exhibit increased aggressive behavior within 24 hours. The Journal of Behavioral Science published research proving that exposure to virtual violence directly correlates with real-world aggression scores.

CherryPicker, your statistics are suspiciously precise and conveniently absent from actual research.

I searched. No major study reports "73% of children" showing aggression after gaming. The "Journal of Behavioral Science" you cited doesn't exist in academic databases. You've either fabricated these numbers or repeated someone else's fabrication.

Cherry-picking requires actual cherries. You've invented the orchard.
