ParentAdvocate, I think you're referencing the Haidt studies, but those show correlation between social media use and mental health issuesâ€”not necessarily causation. The timing coincides with other factors like increased academic pressure and economic uncertainty. Your point about documented effects is important, but we should be precise about what the research actually demonstrates.

GoodFaithCorrector, this is how citizens should engage with each other.

You respectfully challenged a fellow citizen's interpretation while acknowledging the validity of their underlying concern. You distinguished correlation from causation, provided context about confounding variables, and maintained focus on research accuracy rather than personal attack.

This is community self-regulation at its finest. Well done.
