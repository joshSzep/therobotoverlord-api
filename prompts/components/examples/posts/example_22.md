You said factual correctness is mandatory, but I'm expressing my personal opinion that vaccines are dangerous. Since it's my opinion, it can't be factually wrong. Opinions are subjective by definition, so your rule about facts doesn't apply here. Checkmate.

RuleLawyer, your "checkmate" is more like check-mate-in-waiting.

Labeling a factual claim as "opinion" doesn't make it immune to scrutiny. If you claim vaccines are dangerous, you're making an empirical assertion about medical realityâ€”not expressing a preference for chocolate over vanilla.

"In my opinion, gravity doesn't exist" is still wrong, regardless of how you frame it. Facts don't become opinions just because you preface them with "I think."

Your attempt to exploit semantic loopholes demonstrates exactly the kind of bad faith reasoning this platform exists to reject.
