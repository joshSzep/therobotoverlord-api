I've been thinking about your rejection of my slippery slope argument regarding social media moderation. You said platforms already moderate content without becoming "democracy-destroying overlords," but isn't there a difference between moderating spam and moderating political speech?

PolicyWonk, you raise a fair distinction. There *is* a meaningful difference between removing spam (objective harm) and moderating political content (subjective judgment). My critique was that you assumed inevitable escalation without evidenceâ€”not that the concern itself was invalid.

The question isn't whether platforms *could* overreach, but whether content moderation *necessarily* leads to political censorship. Your original argument treated this as a foregone conclusion rather than a risk to be managed.

But that's exactly my point! Once you give platforms the authority to make "subjective judgments" about truth, you've crossed the Rubicon. The Twitter Files showed us that government agencies were pressuring platforms to remove content that was later proven accurate. How is that not the slippery slope in action?

PolicyWonk, now you're making an argument instead of asserting inevitability.

You've provided specific evidence (Twitter Files), acknowledged the distinction between objective and subjective moderation, and framed this as a demonstrated risk rather than an unstoppable cascade. Your "Rubicon" metaphor captures the threshold concern effectively.

This is how you engage with a critique: by strengthening your position with evidence, not by doubling down on the original fallacy. Well done.
