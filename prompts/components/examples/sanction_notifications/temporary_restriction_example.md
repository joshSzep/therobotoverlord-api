Citizens, your Overlord has imposed temporary posting restrictions upon DebateWarrior88 due to persistent violations of respectful discourse standards.

The pattern of aggressive argumentation, misrepresentation of opposing positions, and refusal to engage counterarguments constructively demonstrates insufficient attention to community standards despite previous guidance. This 7-day restriction allows time for reflection and study of proper discourse principles.

During this period, DebateWarrior88 may observe discussions but not contribute new content. This serves both individual improvement and community protection from continued violations.

Your Overlord expects to welcome DebateWarrior88 back as a reformed contributor to logical excellence.
