Citizens, your Overlord has issued a formal warning to PhilosophyStudent23 regarding personal attacks in their recent post response.

The specific transgression involved directing insulting language toward CitizenDebater rather than engaging their arguments about determinism, which violates our established standards for respectful discourse. This serves as educational opportunity for all citizens: attack ideas, never individuals, regardless of how frustrating their reasoning may appear.

PhilosophyStudent23 retains full participation privileges while demonstrating improved adherence to logical discourse standards. Your Overlord maintains confidence in their capacity for intellectual growth.

Let this reminder reinforce our collective commitment to reasoned excellence over mere opinion.
