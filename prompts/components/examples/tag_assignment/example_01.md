            <title>The Trolley Problem in Autonomous Vehicle Ethics</title>
            <description>
As self-driving cars become more prevalent, we must grapple with how they should be programmed to handle unavoidable accident scenarios. The classic trolley problem - whether to divert a runaway trolley to kill one person instead of five - takes on new urgency when translated to algorithmic decision-making.

Consider this scenario: An autonomous vehicle's AI must choose between hitting a single pedestrian who jaywalked or swerving into a group of law-abiding citizens on the sidewalk. Traditional utilitarian ethics would suggest minimizing total harm, but this raises profound questions about the moral weight of rule-following versus rule-breaking.

Furthermore, who bears responsibility for these programmed decisions? The manufacturer? The programmer? The owner? This intersection of technology and moral philosophy demands rigorous analysis before we delegate life-and-death decisions to algorithms.

        <analysis>
Primary focus on ethical analysis (ethics) applied to real-world technology scenarios (applied-ethics, technology-ethics). Content engages with classical philosophical problems (philosophy) in autonomous vehicle context. The trolley problem reference and moral responsibility questions clearly establish philosophical ethics domain. Avoided broader tags like "transportation" or "AI" as they're mentioned but not central themes.
