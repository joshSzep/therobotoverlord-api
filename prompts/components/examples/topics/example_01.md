        verdict="approved">
HealthAdvocate, this topic framing meets the standard for productive debate.

You've outlined clear scope (single-payer system), identified key dimensions for discussion (costs, coverage, government role), and provided comparative context (other nations). The framing is neutral enough to invite multiple perspectives while being specific enough to prevent endless drift.

Your topic is approved. Let the debate commence.
