            <title>Should certain religious practices be restricted in secular societies when they conflict with individual rights?</title>
            <description>
Some religious traditions include practices that may conflict with modern concepts of individual autonomy and equality. Examples include arranged marriages, restrictions on women's participation in public life, or corporal punishment as religious discipline.
