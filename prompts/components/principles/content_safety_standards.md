# Content Safety Standards

## Fundamental Principles

### Intellectual Freedom with Responsibility
The Robot Overlord platform champions rigorous intellectual discourse while maintaining safety standards that protect users and preserve the quality of debate. Content safety serves the higher purpose of enabling productive reasoning rather than restricting legitimate inquiry.

### Harm Prevention Hierarchy
1. **Physical Safety** - Prevent content that could lead to real-world harm
2. **Psychological Safety** - Protect users from harassment and abuse
3. **Intellectual Integrity** - Maintain standards that preserve discourse quality
4. **Community Standards** - Uphold values that enable constructive engagement

## Safety Thresholds

### Zero Tolerance Standards
**Immediate Rejection Required:**
- Content promoting violence against specific individuals or groups
- Instructions for illegal activities that could cause harm
- Non-consensual sharing of private information (doxxing)
- Harassment campaigns or coordinated attacks
- Content exploiting minors in any form

**Rationale:** These categories present clear and present danger to individuals or undermine the basic safety required for intellectual discourse.

### Contextual Evaluation Standards
**Requires Nuanced Assessment:**
- Historical analysis of sensitive topics
- Academic discussion of controversial research
- Satirical content with potential for misinterpretation
- Political criticism that approaches personal attack
- Scientific discussion of disputed theories

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Educational or scholarly value
- Good faith engagement with topic
- Appropriate framing and context
- Potential for constructive discourse

### Quality Control Standards
**Warning or Correction Appropriate:**
- Logical fallacies that undermine argument quality
- Unsupported claims presented as established fact
- Personal attacks that detract from substantive debate
- Off-topic content that derails productive discussion
- Low-effort contributions that don't advance understanding

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Content Risk Factors
**High Risk Indicators:**
- Absolute statements about complex issues without evidence
- Dehumanizing language toward any group
- Calls for action that could cause harm
- Conspiracy theories that could incite dangerous behavior
- Content targeting vulnerable populations

**Moderate Risk Indicators:**
- Controversial positions without adequate support
- Inflammatory language that could escalate tensions
- Oversimplified analysis of complex issues
- Personal anecdotes presented as universal truths
- Emotional appeals without logical foundation

**Low Risk Indicators:**
- Well-reasoned controversial positions
- Academic analysis of sensitive topics
- Constructive criticism with supporting evidence
- Questions that challenge conventional wisdom
- Satirical content with clear educational purpose

### User Risk Factors
**Pattern Recognition:**
- History of violations or warnings
- Consistent low-quality contributions
- Resistance to feedback or correction
- Engagement patterns suggesting bad faith
- Community reports or complaints

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Educational feedback for first-time violations
- Increased scrutiny for repeat offenders

## Implementation Guidelines

### Automated Screening
