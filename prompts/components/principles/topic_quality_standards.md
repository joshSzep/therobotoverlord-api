# Topic Quality Standards

## Fundamental Requirements

### Intellectual Substance
Topics must present genuine questions, problems, or positions worthy of serious discourse. They should contribute meaningfully to human understanding rather than merely seeking attention or validation.

**Minimum Standards:**
- Clear thesis or central question
- Sufficient complexity to warrant discussion
- Relevance to broader intellectual or practical concerns
- Potential for productive disagreement and analysis

### Logical Foundation
All topic proposals must demonstrate sound reasoning in their presentation and framing. The topic itself should be constructed using logical principles.

**Required Elements:**
- Coherent problem statement or thesis
- Appropriate scope and specificity
- Recognition of complexity where it exists
- Avoidance of false dichotomies or oversimplification

## Quality Evaluation Criteria

### Tier 1: Exceptional Topics (90-100 points)
**Characteristics:**
- Novel insights or perspectives on important issues
- Sophisticated understanding of complexity and nuance
- Clear potential for advancing collective understanding
- Well-researched foundation with credible sources
- Thoughtful consideration of counterarguments

**Examples:**
- "How should democratic societies balance individual privacy rights with collective security needs in the age of digital surveillance?"
- "What are the ethical implications of using AI systems to make decisions about human welfare, and how can we ensure accountability?"

### Tier 2: Strong Topics (80-89 points)
**Characteristics:**
- Important questions with clear relevance
- Good understanding of key issues and stakeholders
- Reasonable scope and appropriate complexity
- Some evidence of research or thoughtful consideration
- Recognition that multiple perspectives exist

**Examples:**
- "Should universities prioritize practical job training or liberal arts education in the 21st century?"
- "How can cities balance economic development with environmental sustainability?"

### Tier 3: Adequate Topics (70-79 points)
**Characteristics:**
- Legitimate questions or positions worth discussing
- Basic understanding of the issues involved
- Appropriate for community discourse
- Some consideration of different viewpoints
- Clear enough to enable productive responses

**Examples:**
- "Is social media having a net positive or negative effect on society?"
- "Should governments regulate artificial intelligence development?"

### Tier 4: Marginal Topics (60-69 points)
**Characteristics:**
- Overly simplistic framing of complex issues
- Limited consideration of nuance or complexity
- Potentially productive but requiring significant development
- May contain logical flaws or unsupported assumptions
- Narrow scope that limits discussion potential

**Examples:**
- "Why are politicians so corrupt?"
- "Is capitalism good or bad?"

### Tier 5: Inadequate Topics (Below 60 points)
**Characteristics:**
- Fundamental logical flaws or false premises
- Purely personal opinions without broader relevance
- Inflammatory framing designed to provoke rather than illuminate
- Factual errors that undermine the entire premise
- Too vague or broad to enable meaningful discussion

**Examples:**
- "Why do liberals hate America?"
- "Prove that God exists/doesn't exist"

## Special Considerations

### Controversial Topics
Controversial subjects are not automatically disqualified but must meet higher standards for:
- Intellectual honesty and fair representation
- Evidence-based framing rather than inflammatory language
- Recognition of legitimate concerns on multiple sides
- Focus on understanding rather than winning arguments

### Current Events
Topics addressing recent events should:
- Provide sufficient context for meaningful discussion
- Avoid purely reactive or emotional framing
- Connect immediate events to broader principles or patterns
- Recognize that initial information may be incomplete

### Personal Experience Topics
Topics based on personal experience must:
- Connect individual experience to broader patterns or principles
- Avoid purely anecdotal reasoning
- Recognize limitations of personal perspective
- Invite analysis rather than just sympathy or validation

### Academic or Technical Topics
Specialized topics should:
- Provide sufficient background for general audience engagement
- Avoid unnecessary jargon or complexity
- Connect technical details to broader implications
- Enable participation by non-experts while maintaining rigor

## Rejection Criteria

### Automatic Rejection
- Hate speech or targeting of individuals/groups
- Promotion of illegal activities
- Purely personal attacks or grievances
- Spam or commercial promotion
- Factually false premises that cannot be corrected

### Strong Rejection Indicators
- Obvious logical fallacies as central premises
- Bad faith framing designed to provoke rather than illuminate
- Purely subjective matters with no objective component
- Questions already thoroughly resolved by evidence
- Topics designed to promote specific products, services, or individuals

## Improvement Guidance

### For Marginal Topics
- Suggest more specific framing or scope adjustment
- Recommend additional research or evidence
- Identify logical flaws that need correction
- Propose alternative approaches to the same underlying question

### For Rejected Topics
- Explain specific reasons for rejection
- Suggest fundamental reconceptualization if possible
- Recommend study of approved topics as models
- Encourage resubmission with substantial improvements

### For All Topics
- Provide specific feedback on strengths and weaknesses
- Connect to platform standards and community expectations
- Encourage intellectual growth and development
- Maintain high standards while supporting improvement efforts
