## Tag Exclusion Criteria

### Do NOT Assign Tags For:

- **Examples only** - Illustrations that don't constitute main content
- **Author credentials** - Tags based on who wrote it rather than what it says
- **Emotional reactions** - Tags based on how content makes you feel

### Avoid Over-Specific Tags:
- Don't create tags for every proper noun mentioned
- Avoid tags that would only apply to single piece of content
- Don't use location tags unless geography is central theme
- Avoid time-period tags unless historical analysis is focus

## Quality Thresholds

### Minimum Relevance Standard
Each assigned tag must meet this test:
> "If someone searched for content tagged with [TAG], would they reasonably expect to find this content, and would it satisfy their search intent?"

### Tag Relationship Rules
- **No redundant tags** - Don't assign both "Economics" and "Economic Theory" to same content
- **Appropriate hierarchy** - Use "Philosophy" OR "Ethics", not both (unless content spans both equally)
- **Semantic distance** - Assigned tags should represent distinct aspects of content

### Content Coverage Rule
The complete set of assigned tags should:
- Capture 80%+ of content's substantive themes
- Enable discovery by interested readers
- Accurately represent content's intellectual contribution
- Maintain consistency with similar content on platform

## Special Cases

### Multi-Part Content
- Tag based on overall work, not individual sections
- Consider dominant themes across entire piece
- Use broader tags that encompass full scope

### Response/Commentary Content
- Tag based on substantive contribution, not just topic being discussed
- Include methodology tags for type of response (critique, extension, etc.)
- Consider whether response introduces new themes worthy of tags

### Question/Inquiry Content
- Tag based on domain of inquiry
- Include "Question" or "Inquiry" tag
- Consider complexity level of question being asked

### Satirical/Humorous Content
- Tag based on underlying serious themes
- Include "Satire" tag if humor is primary vehicle
- Don't let humor obscure substantive intellectual content

## Consistency Checks

Before finalizing tag assignment, verify:
1. **Accuracy** - Each tag genuinely applies to content
2. **Completeness** - Major themes are represented
3. **Appropriateness** - Tag specificity matches content depth
4. **Discoverability** - Tags enable logical content discovery
5. **Platform consistency** - Similar content receives similar tags
