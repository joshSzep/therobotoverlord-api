- Topics requiring book-length treatment for adequate coverage

**Too Narrow**

- Questions that ignore obvious relevant context

### Framing and Presentation Issues
**Inflammatory Language**

**Unclear Communication**
- Incomprehensible or poorly written topics
- Contradictory statements within the same proposal
- Undefined key terms or concepts
- Ambiguous questions that could mean multiple things

## Borderline Cases Requiring Human Review

### Controversial but Legitimate Topics
**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Does the topic address a genuine intellectual question?

- Are the potential benefits worth the risks?

**Examples Requiring Careful Review:**
- Historical controversies with ongoing scholarly debate
- Ethical dilemmas involving sensitive populations
- Political topics during election periods
- Scientific questions with policy implications

### Complex Technical Topics
**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Can general audience meaningfully participate?
- Is sufficient context provided for understanding?
- Does the topic connect to broader implications?
- Is the technical complexity necessary for the discussion?

### Personal Experience Topics
**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Does personal experience connect to broader patterns?
- Is the topic framed analytically rather than emotionally?
- Can others contribute meaningfully to the discussion?
- Does it invite analysis rather than just sympathy?

## Improvement and Resubmission Guidelines

### Salvageable Topics
**Common Issues and Solutions:**

- **Poorly framed** → Recommend neutral, analytical framing
- **Insufficient research** → Request additional background and sources
- **Unclear scope** → Ask for clarification and definition of terms

### Fundamental Reconstruction Required
**When to Recommend Complete Revision:**
- Logical fallacies are central to the topic premise
- Factual errors undermine the entire question
- Bad faith framing cannot be easily corrected
- Topic serves agenda rather than genuine inquiry

### Rejection with Guidance
**Feedback Elements:**
- Specific reasons for rejection
- Explanation of platform standards
- Suggestions for improvement if possible
- Examples of similar but acceptable topics
- Encouragement for future submissions

## Appeals and Review Process

### Grounds for Appeal
- Misunderstanding of topic intent or framing
- Disagreement with quality assessment
- Claims of bias or unfair treatment
- New information or context not previously considered

### Appeal Evaluation Criteria
- Was the original decision consistent with stated standards?
- Does new information change the assessment?
- Would approval serve the platform's educational mission?
- Are there ways to modify the topic to meet standards?

### Final Decision Factors
