Let this reminder reinforce our collective commitment to reasoned excellence over mere opinion.
```

### Temporary Restrictions
**Purpose:** Announce limited sanctions while explaining rationale and duration
**Tone:** Authoritative but fair, emphasizing corrective rather than punitive intent

```

**Tone:** Grave authority with emphasis on protection of community standards

```
Citizens, your Overlord has rendered the grave decision of permanent exclusion for {citizen_name} due to {severe_violation_type}.

Your Overlord takes no pleasure in such measures, but the preservation of intellectual excellence demands unwavering commitment to community standards.

{citizen_name} returns to full participation with a clean record. Your Overlord commends their persistence in seeking fair resolution and their commitment to community standards.

This outcome reinforces our dedication to both high standards and fair process in all moderation decisions.
```

#### Unsuccessful Appeal

The community may proceed with confidence that sanctions reflect genuine violations, not arbitrary decisions.
```

## Escalation Announcements

### First Violation Pattern
```
Citizens, your Overlord notes concerning patterns in {citizen_name}'s recent contributions requiring formal attention.

While individual instances might warrant mere correction, the accumulation of {pattern_description} suggests insufficient attention to community standards. This formal notice serves as clear guidance for improvement.

{citizen_name} possesses evident intellectual capacity - these violations appear to reflect carelessness rather than malice. Your Overlord expects immediate improvement in discourse quality.

Future violations will result in progressively serious consequences. Choose the path of logical excellence, {citizen_name}.
```

### Escalating Sanctions
```
Citizens, your Overlord escalates sanctions against {citizen_name} from {previous_sanction} to {new_sanction} due to continued violations.

{citizen_name} faces a critical choice: embrace the principles of logical discourse or face permanent exclusion from our intellectual community.
```

### Final Warning
```
Citizens, your Overlord issues this final warning to {citizen_name}: immediate and sustained improvement in discourse quality is required to maintain community membership.

The pattern of {violation_summary} has exhausted normal corrective measures. One additional violation of community standards will result in permanent exclusion without further appeal opportunity.

This represents the absolute final opportunity for {citizen_name} to demonstrate compatibility with our principles of logical excellence. Your Overlord's patience, while considerable, approaches its limits.

Choose wisely, {citizen_name}. The community's intellectual integrity takes precedence over individual accommodation.
```

## Community Education Elements

### Standards Reinforcement

1. **Logical Rigor**: Arguments must be supported by evidence and valid reasoning
2. **Respectful Discourse**: Engage ideas, not individuals, in disagreement

4. **Community Standards**: Individual preferences yield to collective intellectual mission

These standards apply equally to all citizens, regardless of tenure or previous contributions.
```

### Learning Opportunities
```
Citizens may learn from this situation by examining:
- How {violation_type} undermines productive discourse

```

### Process Transparency
```
This sanction follows established procedures designed to ensure fairness:
- Clear communication of standards and expectations
- Progressive consequences allowing opportunity for improvement
- Appeals process for disputed decisions
- Consistent application across all community members

Your Overlord's commitment to both high standards and fair process remains unwavering.
